# TranscribeHelper
This is not a full on automatic music transcriber, it is simply an audio player with some features (so far just time-stretching, pitch shifting, and looping is on the agenda). I am making this as a way to help me with transcribing guitar parts and gaining a better ear.

Right now it is able play and loop through different sections of a song.

## TODO: 
* Open file while song is still playing (background thread)
* Implement home and end functionality.
* Implement time-stretching and pitch shifting.
